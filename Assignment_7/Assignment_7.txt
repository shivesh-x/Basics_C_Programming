1.Write a program which accept two numbers from user and calculate its power.
Input : 3 4
Output : 81
Input : 7 3
Output : 343

2. Write a program which accept number from user and check whether that number is strong number or not. When the sum of the factorial of a number's individual digits are equal to the number itself, then that number is called a strong number.
